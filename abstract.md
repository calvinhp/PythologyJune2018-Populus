# Writing Smart Contracts wth Python and Populus

## Pythology June 2018

## Abstract

Like Python, but want to write Smart Contacts for the Ethereum Blockchain? Getting started with Populus is the tool for you. [Populus](http://populus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a development framework for the Ethereum blockchain. Armed with the Solidiy complier and the Geth client, we will write our first smart contract including writing unit tests in `pytest`. Using the `populus` tools, we can deploy and run on our local blockchain to kick the tires. We will cover some of the sharp edges of smart contract development and how `populus` helps make life easier for Python developers in this brave new world.
